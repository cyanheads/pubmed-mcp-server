      "title": "The compound (E)-2-(3,4-dihydroxystyryl)-3-hydroxy-4H-pyran-4-one alleviates neuroinflammation and cognitive impairment in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.",
      "abstractText": "JOURNAL/nrgr/04.03/01300535-202511000-00034/figure1/v/2024-12-20T164640Z/r/image-tiff Previous studies have shown that the compound (E)-2-(3,4-dihydroxystyryl)-3-hydroxy-4H-pyran-4-one (D30), a pyromeconic acid derivative, possesses antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, inhibits amyloid-&#x3b2; aggregation, and alleviates scopolamine-induced cognitive impairment, similar to the phase III clinical drug resveratrol. In this study, we established a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease via intracerebroventricular injection of fibrillar amyloid-&#x3b2; to investigate the effect of D30 on fibrillar amyloid-&#x3b2;-induced neuropathology. Our results showed that D30 alleviated fibrillar amyloid-&#x3b2;-induced cognitive impairment, promoted fibrillar amyloid-&#x3b2; clearance from the hippocampus and cortex, suppressed oxidative stress, and inhibited activation of microglia and astrocytes. D30 also reversed the fibrillar amyloid-&#x3b2;-induced loss of dendritic spines and synaptic protein expression. Notably, we demonstrated that exogenous fibrillar amyloid-&#x3b2; introduced by intracerebroventricular injection greatly increased galectin-3 expression levels in the brain, and this increase was blocked by D30. Considering the role of D30 in clearing amyloid-&#x3b2;, inhibiting neuroinflammation, protecting synapses, and improving cognition, this study highlights the potential of galectin-3 as a promising treatment target for patients with Alzheimer's disease.",

However, whether interferon regulatory factor 7-mediated signaling contributes to Parkinson's disease remains unknown. Here we report that interferon regulatory factor 7 is markedly up-regulated in a 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine-induced mouse model of Parkinson's disease and co-localizes with microglial cells. Both the selective cyclic guanosine monophosphate adenosine monophosphate synthase inhibitor RU.521 and the stimulator of interferon genes inhibitor H151 effectively suppressed interferon regulatory factor 7 activation in BV2 microglia exposed to 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium and inhibited transformation of mouse BV2 microglia into the neurotoxic M1 phenotype. In addition, siRNA-mediated knockdown of interferon regulatory factor 7 expression in BV2 microglia reduced the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase, tumor necrosis factor &#x3b1;, CD16, CD32, and CD86 and increased the expression of the anti-inflammatory markers ARG1 and YM1. Taken together, our findings indicate that the cyclic guanosine monophosphate adenosine monophosphate synthase-stimulator of interferon genes-interferon regulatory factor 7 pathway plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease.",

      "abstractText": "&#x3b1;-Synuclein (&#x3b1;-syn), a pathological hallmark of PD, is emerging as a bridging element at the crossroads between neuro/immune-inflammatory responses and neurodegeneration in PD. Several evidence show that pathological &#x3b1;-syn accumulates in neuronal and non-neuronal cells (i.e., neurons, microglia, macrophages, skin cells, and intestinal cells) in central and peripheral tissues since the prodromal phase of the disease, contributing to brain pathology. Indeed, pathological &#x3b1;-syn deposition can promote neurogenic/immune-inflammatory responses that contribute to systemic and central neuroinflammation associated with PD. After providing an overview of the structure and functions of physiological &#x3b1;-syn as well as its pathological forms, we review current studies about the role of neuronal and non-neuronal &#x3b1;-syn at the crossroads between neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration in PD. In addition, we provide an overview of the correlation between the accumulation of &#x3b1;-syn in central and peripheral tissues and PD, related symptoms, and neuroinflammation. Special attention was paid to discussing whether targeting &#x3b1;-syn can represent a suitable therapeutical approach for PD.",
